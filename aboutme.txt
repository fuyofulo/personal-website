Some things I believe in:

While the saying 'comparison is the thief of joy' often holds true, it does not universally apply. When employed judiciously, comparison can yield profound and valuable insights. 

Conmpounding over an extended period of time produces substantial result. However the joy and fulfilment derived from such achievements surpasses the satisfaction of quick outcomes.
